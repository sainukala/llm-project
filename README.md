# Leveraging Language Models for SQL Query Generation
## **Introduction**

In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the ability to convert general language queries into specific SQL queries is a significant advancement. This blog post delves into a project where I utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose. The project involves integrating Cohere Ai's LLM with MySQL and Chroma for Vector DB hosting, demonstrating a practical application of these technologies in query generation and database management.
## **Fundamentals**
The core idea of this project is to interpret consumer queries posed in natural language and convert them into SQL queries for execution.
